# adex-market
The market is a RESTful service maintained and hosted by AdEx Network OÃœ.

The primary role of the market is to facilitate demand/supply discovery and trading. It keeps record of all campaigns that are currently valid, and allows publishers/advertisers to query that list in order to find what they need.

The market needs to track all on-chain OUTPACE channels and needs to constantly monitor their liveness (>=2/3 validators online and producing new states) and state.

Additional privacy can be achieved by having groups of publishers/advertisers run their own instances of the market - that way, campaigns will be visible only within their private group.
